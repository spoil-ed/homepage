<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at Fudan University, Shanghai. My research focuses on **Embodied Intelligence** and **multimodal foundation models**, with particular interests in:

- Diffusion Policies for Robotic Manipulation  
- Vision-Language-Action Models (VLA)  
- Embodied AI in Real-World Environments  

Currently, I have one first-author paper **under review at CVPR 2026**.  
All code and projects are open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/spoil-ed).
